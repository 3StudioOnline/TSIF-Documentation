## Publish Name

`IPNS Publish Name` publishes (or republishes) an IPNS name through a pinning service. This function requires inputs as
follows:
* `Ipfs Address` <Step text="1"/> : Struct, holds the CID and path of the file on *IPFS* network.
* `Private Key PEM` <Step text="2"/> : Byte array, they private key used to sign the record in `PEM` encoding.
* `Ipns Service` <Step text="3"/> : Enum, the pinning service used to publish the record.

There's also additional inputs that can be left empty, but offer additional control over the name:
* `Password` <Step text="4"/> : UTF-8 String, pass-phrase used to decrypt the private key
(should stay empty if the key is not encrypted).
* `Lifetime` <Step text="5"/> : Timespan, the length of time for which the record will be valid without additional
republishing. By default, this value is set to 1 year (365 days).
* `Ttl` <Step text="6"/> : uint64, this is a DNS-related term better explained
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live). The default value is 300 (5 minutes).
* `Request Name` <Step text="7"/> : Name, a unique identifier for the plugin's HTTP subsystem. It allows to fetch the
request by name. This is purely optional and only changes how the HTTP request will be managed internally by the plugin.

The returned *Response* is a struct that holds data such as headers, status code, and body of the response of the HTTP
request.

:::info
If *Success* is *True* that only means that the response from the *IPFS* network was successful only.
:::

If successful, returns the request structure <Step text="8"/> containing the record field values and the IPNS name.
