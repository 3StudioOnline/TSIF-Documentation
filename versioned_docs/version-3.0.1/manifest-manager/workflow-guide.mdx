## Step 1: Prepare your Game Project

This workflow makes use of Unreal Engine's built-in
[Project Launcher](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-the-project-launcher-in-unreal-engine)
and its profiles. The **Chunker Manifest Manager** will help you in creating
and setting up those profiles correctly.

### Create Project Profile

First, create a *Project Profile* by clicking `Create` in the *Project* section.

![Create Project Profile](_static/img/create-project-profile.png)

Usually, you will see the message `Missing cooked maps` after creating a new
*Project Profile* which is expected.

![Revalidate Maps](_static/img/missing-cooked-maps.png)

### Resolve "Missing cooked maps"

In order to resolve this configuration issue, go to the
`Tools` <Step text="1"/> menu in the *Unreal Engine* editor window and select
`Project Launcher` <Step text="2"/>.

![Open Project Launcher](_static/img/open-project-launcher.png)

In the *Project Launcher* window, you will find a section labeled
*Custom Launch Profiles*. All your existing project and *Game Feature*
profiles will be displayed here. For now, you should only see one profile which
is the *Project Profile* named after your game project.

Click on the *gear* <Step text="3"/> button next to your *Project Profile* to
edit it.

![Edit Project Profile](_static/img/edit-project-profile.png)

Next, scroll down within this *Project Profile* until you find a section labeled
`Cooked Maps`.

Make sure there is at least one map of your project selected <Step text="4"/>
that will be cooked with the project later.

Then, click on the `Back` <Step text="5"/> button to save your changes and close
the *Project Launcher* window.

![Select Maps](_static/img/select-maps.png)

When switching back to the *Chunker Manifest Manager* window you may still see
the message about missing cooked maps. Click the `Revalidate` <Step text="6"/>
button to let **Chunker Manifest Manager** check again for any configuration
issues.

![Revalidate Maps](_static/img/revalidate-cooked-maps.png)

The error message should have disappeared now after revalidating.

### Resolve "No Game Features available"

In case you do not have any *Game Features* in your project yet, you will see
the message `No Game Features available` in the *Game Features* section.

You can use the button <Step text="1"/> in the top right corner to refresh this
list.

![No Game Features available.](_static/img/no-game-features.png)

:::note
If your project already uses **Game Features**, you can skip this section and
continue with [Step 2](#step-2-prepare-your-game-features).
:::

:::danger Important
To make use of **Chunker Manifest Manager**, you need to have at least one
*Game Feature* in your game project and at least one of them needs to be
*enabled*.

Follow the
[official documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-features-and-modular-gameplay-in-unreal-engine)
to create at least one *Game Feature*.
:::

If you still see this message after opening the `Version` tab, make sure your
*Game Features* are enabled.

Open `Edit` <Step text="1"/> menu, then click `Plugins` <Step text="2"/>.

![Open Plugins](_static/img/open-plugins.png)

This will open the *Plugins* window. On the left hand side, select the
`Game Features` <Step text="3"/> category and make sure the
checkbox <Step text="4"/> next to your *Game Feature(s)* are enabled. You may
need to restart the editor <Step text="5"/> afterward.

![Enable Game Features](_static/img/enable-game-feature.png)

## Step 2: Prepare your Game Features

In the `Version` tab of *Chunker Manifest Manager*, you should see a list of
available *Game Features*.

![Game Features Are Available.](_static/img/game-freature-exists.png)

### Create Game Feature Profiles

Now it's time to create profiles for your *Game Features*. Select one or more
*Game Features* <Step text="1"/> and click on the
`Create Profile` <Step text="2"/> button.

![Create Game Features Profiles](_static/img/create-game-features-profiles.png)

## Step 3: Create `.pak` files from *Game Features*

In order to create `.pak` files that can be uploaded later, each *Game Feature*
needs to be built by using the corresponding *Project Launcher* profiles.

In the *Unreal Engine* editor window, go to `Tools` <Step text="1"/> menu and
select `Project Launcher` <Step text="2"/>.

![Open Project Launcher](_static/img/open-project-launcher.png)

In the *Project Launcher* window you will see a list of all your project and
*Game Features* profiles that you just created.

:::info
Before you can build any of your *Game Features* you need to build your
*Game Project* first.
:::

Find your *Project Profile* and click on its `Launch` <Step text="3"/> button.

After this process has finished, continue with building your *Game Features*.
To do so, find the *Game Features* that you want to build and click on their
`Launch` <Step text="4"/> buttons, one after another.

![Launch Project Profile](_static/img/launch-project-profile.png)

At this point, you should find one created `.pak` file per *Game Feature*.

Starting from the root directory of your Unreal project, the path to each `.pak`
file can be found as follows:

- `./`<Highlight>`PROJECT_NAME`</Highlight>`/Plugins/GameFeatures`
    - `/`<Highlight>`GAME_FEATURE_NAME`</Highlight>`/Saved/StagedBuilds`
        - `/`<Highlight>`TARGET_PLATFORM`</Highlight>
            - `/`<Highlight>`PROJECT_NAME`</Highlight>`/Plugins/GameFeatures`
                - `/`<Highlight>`GAME_FEATURE_NAME`</Highlight>`/Content/Paks`
                    - `/`<Highlight>`TARGET_PLATFORM`</Highlight>

:::tip
Copy or move `.pak` files of your *Game Features* into one directory, so that
all of them can easily be selected at once for uploading later.
:::

## Step 4: Upload Game Features to IPFS

### IPFS Settings

In order to upload *Game Features* to IPFS, you need to choose a
*Pinning Service* and add your credentials for it in the
`IPFS Settings` <Step text="1"/> tab.

First, select the *Pinning Service* <Step text="2"/> you would like to use.
Depending on the selected service, the inputs below for the required credentials
may change.

In this example, we chose *Web3.Storage* as our *Pinning Service* and have to
provide a *DID*, *Authorization Secret*, and
*Authorization Token* <Step text="3"/>.

![IPFS Settings](_static/img/ipfs-settings.png)

:::tip
Credentials are saved per *Pinning Service* so that switching between them is
quick and easy.
:::

### Upload

Now, open then `Upload` <Step text="1"/> tab. This is where you can select
your `.pak` files for uploading to IPFS. Click on the
`Select PAK Files...` <Step text="2"/> button to open the file dialog and select
the `.pak` files you want to upload to IPFS.

The list labeled as *Upload to IPFS* should now be populated with the `.pak`
files you selected and be ready for upload. To start uploading, click the
`Upload PAK Files` <Step text="3"/>  button. This process might take a while to
finish, depending on the amount of files, their size, and your internet speed.

After the upload has finished, you should see a *CID* <Step text="4"/> being
displayed next to each `.pak` file. You can copy those *CIDs* directly from the
`Upload` tab here. Also, the full list of file names and *CIDs* is printed to
the `Output Log` in the *Unreal Engine* editor.

![Upload PAK Files](_static/img/upload-pak.png)

:::note
Uploaded `.pak` files and their corresponding *CIDs* can always be found later
using the *Pinning Service's* dashboard on their website.
:::

## Step 5: Construct Game Manifest and Upload to IPNS

In order to create or update an *IPNS Name*, a *PEM Key* is required. It is
used for authorization so that only you as the owner of a specific *IPNS Name*
can control its contents.

### IPNS Settings

Navigate to the `IPNS Settings` <Step text="1"/> tab.

If you already have a *PEM Key*, simply click on the
`Browse...` <Step text="2"/> button and select your file to use it.

In the case that you do not have a *PEM Key* yet, click on the
`Generate PEM Key...` <Step text="3"/> button to generate a new one.

Alternatively, you can import an existing *PEM Key* from text by clicking the
`Import PEM Key from Text...` <Step text="4"/> button. It will open a dialog
where you can paste the text to import your key.


![IPNS Settings](_static/img/ipns-settings.png)

Your *PEM Key* should now be set up and ready for use.

:::danger Important
Make sure to store your *PEM Key* in a safe location. If you lose it, you will
not be able to update the corresponding *IPNS Name* again.
:::

### Construct and Upload

Navigate to the `Manifest` <Step text="1"/> tab. There you will see a list of
all your *Game Features* in the project.

Select the *Game Features* <Step text="2"/> that you would like to include in
the *Game Manifest* and click on the  <Step text="3"/> `Construct Manifest`
button.

This will create a file called `GameManifest.json` at
`./`<Highlight>`PROJECT_NAME`</Highlight>`/Saved/IPFS-Developer/`.

:::tip
The direcotry name can be changed in the *Project Settings* under
`3Studio | IPFS (User Settings)`, then find the setting under
`Developer | IPFS Developer Directory`.
:::

After the *Game Manifest* is constructed, click on the <Step text="4"/>
`Upload Manifest` button to upload it to IPNS.

![Manifest](_static/img/manifest.png)

This will first upload the *Game Manifest* file to IPFS. After that, your
*IPNS Name* will be created/updated to now point to the CID of the
*Game Manifest* that was uploaded just a moment before.


The *Game Manifest*'s *CID* and *IPNS Name* will both appear as notifications on
the screen and in the *Unreal Engine* editor's `Output Log`.

![Manifest Notification](_static/img/manifest-notification.png)

![Manifest Log](_static/img/manifest-log.png)

## Step 6: Project update pipeline

Although it is possible to use *Manifest Manager's* functionality in many
different ways, this tool was built with a specific game update pipeline in
mind.

By following this pipeline you ensure to benefit the most when using this tool.

### Versioning

After you made new changes to your project and/or *Game Features*, you
will want to release an update on IPFS. Your first step should be to update the
*Project Version*.

Even if changes were only made in a single *Game Feature*, it should still be
represented in your *Project Version*. In case changes were made in one
or more *Game Features*, set their version to the new *Project Version*.

Do **not** apply the new version to *Game Features* that were not updated.

It is crucial to update the *Project Version* even if only a single game feature
has been modified as this ensures consistency and clarity in the development
process.

By using this method you ensure a clear overview of timeline when each of the
*Game Features* were updated.
