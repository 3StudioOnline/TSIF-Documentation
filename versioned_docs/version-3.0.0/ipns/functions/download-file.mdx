## Download File Function

`IPFS Download File` Downloads a file from the *IPFS* network for the specified CID/Path. This function requires
inputs as follows:

* `Ipfs Http Gateway` <Step text="1"/> : Struct, holds the url of the gateway to send the request to.
* `Ipns Name` <Step text="2"/> : UTF-8 String, holds the **IPNS name** used to resolve the requested data.
* `Write To File path` <Step text="3"/> : The filepath where the downloaded data is written to.
* `Create Path If Missing` <Step text="4"/> : Creates the filepath to where the downloaded data should be written to
if it is missing.
* `Overwrite Existing File` <Step text="5"/> : If set to false and the file exists this function will abort with failure.
Otherwise, an existing file will be overwritten.

There's also an optional input `Request Name` <Step text="6"/>, a unique identifier for the plugin's HTTP subsystem. It
allows to fetch the request by name. This is purely optional and only changes how the HTTP request will be managed
internally by the plugin.

The returned *Response* is a struct that holds data such as headers, status code, and body of the response of the HTTP
request.

:::info
If *Success* is *True* that means that the response from the *IPFS* network was successful and writing file to disk to
the specified path was also successful.
