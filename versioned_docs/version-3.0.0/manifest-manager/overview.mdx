## What is Chunker Manifest Manager

The Chunker Manifest Manager is a tool designed to simplify the process of version management for both project and Game Features, PAK file uploading, as well as creation and uploading of the game manifest.
This tool is directly integrated with the [IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) and [IPNS (InterPlanetary Naming System)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/),
and makes it be as easy as possible to utilize these decentralized storage systems.
With its user-friendly interface, the Chunker Manifest Manager simplifies complex processes into just a few clicks, allowing developers to efficiently manage updates of their projects and Game Features.
Each tab in the Chunker Manifest Manager is designed to guide you through the essential steps of managing your game project, from versioning and file uploading to manifest creation and deployment.
This structured approach ensures a smooth and efficient workflow for project of any complexity and scope.

## Version Tab

The Version tab is the starting point for preparing your game project for building and deployment.
Here, you will set the version for your entire project as well as for individual Game Features.
This ensures that any updates or changes made to Game Features are properly represented by their versions.
By maintaining a clear versioning system, you can easily track changes and updates over time, providing a structured timeline of your project's development history.

## Upload Tab

The Upload tab is where you will be uploading Game Features PAK files to the IPFS by selecting your files and initiating the uploading process with just a one click.
After the upload is complete, the unique content identifiers (CIDs) for the uploaded files will be displayed and can be copied to be later used to reference these files on the IPFS network.

## Manifest Tab

The Manifest tab is where you construct and upload the game's manifest to IPNS.
Here you can select the game features to include in the manifest and generate a `GameManifest.json` file. After constructing the manifest, you can upload it to IPNS, where it will be assigned a unique CID and IPNS name.
