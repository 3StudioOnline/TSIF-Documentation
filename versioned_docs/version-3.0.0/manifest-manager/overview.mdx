## What is Chunker Manifest Manager

The **Chunker Manifest Manager** is a tool designed to simplify the process of
version management for both project and *Game Features*, `.pak` file uploading, as
well as creation and uploading of the game manifest.
This tool is directly integrated with
[IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/)
and [IPNS (InterPlanetary Naming System)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/)
and enables you to utilize these decentralized storage systems with ease.

With its user-friendly interface, the **Chunker Manifest Manager** simplifies
complex processes into just a few clicks, allowing developers to efficiently
manage updates of their projects and *Game Features*.
Each tab in the **Chunker Manifest Manager** is designed to guide you through
the essential steps of managing your game project, from versioning and file
uploading to manifest creation and deployment.
This structured approach ensures a smooth and efficient workflow for projects of
any complexity and scope.

## Version Tab

The Version tab is the starting point for preparing your game project for
building and deployment. Here, you will set the version for your entire project
as well as for individual *Game Features*. This ensures that any updates or
changes made to *Game Features* are properly represented by their versions. By
maintaining a clear versioning system, you can easily track changes and updates
over time, providing a structured timeline of your project's development
history.

## Upload Tab

The Upload tab is where you will be uploading *Game Feature* `.pak` files to
IPFS by selecting your files and initiating the uploading process with a single
click. After the upload is complete, the unique content identifiers (CIDs) for
the uploaded files will be displayed and can be copied to be later used to
reference these files on the IPFS network.

## Manifest Tab

The Manifest tab is where you construct (and update) the game's manifest before
uploading it to IPNS. You first select the *Game Features* that should be
included in the manifest to construct. The action of constructing a manifest
results in a newly generated `GameManifest.json` file. After constructing the
manifest, you can upload it to IPNS to create or update the IPNS Record that is
associated with your PEM Key.
