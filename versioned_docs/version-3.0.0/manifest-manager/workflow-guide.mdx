It is recommended to copy/move PAK files of your Game Features into one directory, so later all of them can be selected at once for uploading.

## Construct and upload Manifest to IPNS

### IPNS Settings

* Before working with manifest you need to set a PEM key. Go to `IPNS Settings` <Step text="1"/> tab.
If you already have a PEM key saved as .pem file you can click `Browse...` <Step text="2"/> and select the file.

## Project update pipeline

* Although this is possible to use Manifest Manager's functionality in many different ways, this tool is build with the idea of specific game update pipeline.
By following this pipeline you can ensure the most effectiveness of this tool.

### Versioning

* After changes were made in your Project and/or Game Features, and it's ready for an update, first step is to update Project version.
Even if changes were made only in one of the Game Features, it should still be represented in Project Version.
Then in case if changes were made in one or more Game Features, set their version to new Project version. Do not apply new version to Game Features that didn't get updated.
It's crucial to update the project version even if only a single game feature has been modified, as this ensures consistency and clarity in the development process.
By using this method you ensure a clear overview of timeline when each of the Game Features was updated.
